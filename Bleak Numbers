Given an integer, check whether it is Bleak or not.
A number ‘n’ is called Bleak if it cannot be represented as sum of a positive number x and set bit count in x,
i.e., x + countSetBits(x) is not equal to n for any non-negative number x.


PROBLEM: I/P- N=3
         O/P- 0
         
         Explain: 3 is not a Bleak number as (2 + countSetBit(2)) = 3.
         
         I/P- N=4
         O/P- 1
         
         Explain: There is no any possible x such that (x + countSetbit(x)) = 4
         
         
         
SOLUTION:

int is_bleak(int n)
	{
	    for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
	        if((i+(__builtin_popcount(i)))==n){                       //__builtin_popcount(i) is to count set bits in a given no.
	            return 0;
	        }
	    }
	    return 1;
	}
